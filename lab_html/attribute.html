                    Defines a URL at which can be found more information about the image. It was written out of the HTML5 specification, but its status is not quite so clear as other deprecated features.      <br>
                    Previously used to specify the number of times a video should play, when used in conjunction with the dynsource attribute. Both attributes have been deprecated.                             <br>

                    This attribute does nothing. It was once used by a proprietary software system.                                                                                                              <br>
                    Was intended to prevent users from downloading an image. Was never a part of the HTML specification, and not widely implemented.                                                             <br>
                    Was used in conjunction with the dynsrc attribute to add a video that would load in supported browsers in the place of the image that would otherwise be displayed.                          <br>
                    Used by the now-defunct Netscape browser to suppress the display of image prior to image download completion.                                                                                <br>
